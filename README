ImageFun is a simple app to play around with images on the 
iPhone. It has some functions to do image processing on
pictures obtained from the iphone camera or photo album.

You can do image inversion and some edge detection (with a 
fixed threshold at the moment). More image processing 
functions and effects will be added in the coming weeks
(embossing, glares, etc.) as time permits.


The project is being built using openFrameworks for iPhone,
if you want to play around with the code, you will need 
openFrameworks for iPhone version 0061 which is available
at:

http://www.openframeworks.cc/download

Many thanks to Memo, Zach Gage for oF for iPhone as well as
Zach, Theo, Arturo and the rest of the openFrameworks team.
